A way to make some very chill iced coffee.

Ingredients:

1 cup fresh roughly ground coffee
Water
some sweetened condensed milk
some half and half

Steps:

1. Add the coffee to a 34oz French press and combine with water to fill the
French press.
2. Let the coffee sit in the water for 30 seconds to a minute.
3. Still the coffee briefly.
4. Cover and store in the fridge overnight, for at least 12 hours.
5. Remove chilled coffee from the fridge.
6. Fill a pint glass or mason jar (obviously you should choose the jar) with
ice.
7. Pour in the coffee until it is near the top of the ice.
8. Add a splash of water to dilute the coffee concentrate.
9. Drizzle the condensed milk into the coffee.
10. Top off the drink with the half and half.

Who would have though you could make iced coffee in as many as 10 steps?
